--BASIC SETUP--

For OC mod versions <  2.0, you're only option is to connect to a special server
running the OC mod in editoc (development) mode.

For OC mod versions >= 2.0, you can also simply start your Tremulous client, select
'mods', and select 'oc'.  Then load a map using the console, usually with '/devmap'
(enable all cheats) if you're working alone, or '/map' (enable some cheats only
if the player can edit the OC) if you have other people testing.

This server is running version ${g_version}

--START BUILDING--

To start building a NEW OC:
1: Load the map (with '/devmap' or '/map')
2: Save the INITIAL LAYOUT without building anything by
    - using '/layoutsave layoutname', where layoutname
    - is a valid OC layout name (see '^2/info layout^7').
    - You should usually use 'oc' as the layoutname,
    - since you can change it later.
3: '/restart layoutname'
4: '/editoc 1' to enable admins to edit OC's, or '/editoc 2' to enable
    - everybody to edit OC's.
5: Start building.  In the future, you'll be able to continue working on
    - it by following the below instructions.

To continue building an OC on which you have already begun working:
1: Load the map (with '/devmap' or '/map')
2: '/listlayouts' to see your layout's name in case you forgot it.
3: '/restart layoutname'

Tips:
- You probably want to disable g_markDeconstruct.

--BUILDING THE OC--

An OC will need at least a method of spawning (by building an egg or telenode),
and at least one medi or armoury.

Check that there are no existing similar OC's for the same map.  If there is
another OC of the same or similar type, make sure that yours is much better or much different,
otherwise you might not have much luck getting your obstacle course accepted.  One possible
exception is extending or improving an existing OC.

Try to fill as much of the map as you can (without exceeding the 1024-4096 or so
buildable limit, of course), to the extent deemed reasonable.  Courses that leave
large portions of the map without buildables will most likely not be accepted.

It pretty much boils down to common sense; there's really not many restrictions
aside from the load the server can handle.

But most importantly, try not to be too repetitive, mainly with existing courses.
These tend to become uninteresting.  When options run low, making a map yourself
is always an option.


You can manually power or unpower a buildable by setting its ''group''.  Use
'/groupUp' and '/groupDown' to change a buildable's group, or '/group' to
see the buildable's current group without changing it.  Group 2 is unpowered,
group 1 is powered, and group 0 buildables will use default tremulous behaviour
to determine its power.  Telenodes are grouped for teleportation.  When a telenode
is used, the player will be teleported to the closest telenode in the same group, or
if none exist, nothing happens.  If telenodes are in group 0, they are used for spawning
humans, and will not teleport.  Grouping has no effect on eggs.  Telenodes and eggs
by default use group 0, and everything else has a default of group 2.

Use '/buildableOverride' to toggle buildableOverride.  With buildable override enabled,
you can build inside of walls, stack buildables, and build inside of other buildables.
When buildableOverride is disabled, you will not be able to stack buildables.
Note that courses that are valid (built with buildableOverride disabled) are considered
''pure courses'', and are good since they'll load even a non-oc environment.

For OC mods < v2.0, to spawn group, use '/spawnUp', '/spawnDown', and '/spawn' in the same sense as '/groupUp',
etc.  Spawn grouping is used to stack buildables correctly.  Spawn group the lowest buildable with the lowest
group, and each buildable higher needs to use a higher group.  Since version 2.0, stacking is done automatically,
and these commands don't exist.

For OC mods <  v2.0, cheating would be done in editoc mode with the commands /cheat-(noclip|god|notarget|speed).
For OC mods >= v2.0, cheating is done in the same manner as cheating in devmap mode, and the above admin commands
don't exist.

(Saving a template layout with the correct flags and then loading it can help
ensure that e.g. optimizations specific to which teams can play are set, e.g.
if powered turrets and teslas are wanted.)

--SAVING THE OC--

In case the server crashes or anything bad like that happens, it is recommended to save
frequently.  Use '/layoutsave layoutname' (or '/layoutsavereview' if you don't have permission)
to save.

This will save the layout in your base directory.  It'll be base/layouts/mapname/layoutname.dat

Don't use any obsolete or unsupported flags.

--SUBMITTING THE OC--

See '^2/info contact^7'.  Just have the layout file ready (for review).

Also find out in which difficulty category your OC fits (see '^2/info list^7' for
categories)
